# EmuGUI Migra

The migration tool for the upcoming EmuGUI 2.1 "Fatima Nejla" update.

## Build

This is still in progress, but here is what you need to do.

### Windows

Prerequisites for building on Windows (just a recommendation):
- Windows 10 Version 2004, Server 2022 or later (64-bit)
- At least an amd64 Dual-Core CPU, preferably with 4 threads
- Preferably at least 8 GB of RAM your OS can actually use (4 GB might work, but you might run into issues)

I recommend the following:
- A Quad-Core CPU, preferably with 8 threads
- 16 GB of RAM your OS can actually use

1. 
2. 
3. Install the modules using `pip install PySide6 pyinstaller pywin32`
